    Thank-you for installing Kita!
    To get started begin editing the files inside the /src/ directory. Everything will be compiled and put into /dist/ where it's served and automatically reloaded by Browsersync.
    Pug files will be compiled into HTML with the contents of data.json available to you, Stylus into CSS, CoffeeScript into JavaScript, and YAML into JSON.
