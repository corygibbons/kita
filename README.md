# Kita
Kita is a starter kit that aims to help you quickly get a static site up and running. It uses Gulp as a build system to compile Pug, Stylus, YAML, and CoffeeScript. All changes are then automatically pushed to your browser(s) using Browsersync.

## Setup
Make sure you have NPM and Gulp installed. If not, NPM comes with Node and can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Gulp can be installed globally with the following command:
```
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

Make sure you're in the /kita directory and install all dependencies using:
```
$ npm install
```

Then run:
```
$ gulp
```
and you should be up and running.
