# Kita
Kita is a starter kit that aims to help you quickly get a static site up and running. It uses NPM scripts as a build system to handle Pug, PostCSS, and ES6. All changes are then automatically pushed to your browser(s) using Browsersync.

## Setup

Make sure you have NPM installed. If not, NPM comes with Node and can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone the repo and install all dependencies using:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/corygibbons/kita.git && cd kita
$ npm install
```

To start the watcher run:
```
$ npm start
```
Or to build everything once run:
```
$ npm run build
```
